## AML Final Proejct Group 24

According to statistical data, 50% of people aged 12 and over have illicitly used drugs in their lifetime in the US and over 70,000 drug overdose deaths occur annually. Therefore, it is useful to discover what factors affect drug consumption behavior and predict peopleâ€™s abusing degree. We use the Drug Consumption Dataset from UCI to make predictions about drug usage of participants given their personality measurements and past drug use. This is a multiclass classification problem involving 1885 samples, 12 features and 19 classes.
